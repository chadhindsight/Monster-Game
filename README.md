# Monster Game Project

Built with a basic implementation of Vue JS, this web app pits the user against a monster in a traditional RPG scenario. 

## How it works

Run the index.html file in a browser. The player chooses how to attack the monster and the monster also attacks the player. The damage done is calculated and dispalyed. Hopefully you'll find it fun
